# Responsive Design Portfolio

This project is based on a [design mockup portfolio](https://github.com/leahpjoyce/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) designed by Udacity. I used HTML, CSS, and make my site Responsive to all screen sizes. I'm improving this project and want to add more functionality.
