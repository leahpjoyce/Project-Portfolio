# Responsive Design Portfolio

This project is based on a [design mockup portfolio](https://github.com/leahpjoyce/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) designed by Udacity. I used HTML, CSS, and Responsive Design to build my project.

I'm still working on this project while building my skills in HTML, CSS, and Responsive Design.
